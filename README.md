# ReverseRecruiter API

An API that can be used to detect emails from recruiters.


## Motivation

Software recruiters use their own set of automated tools, which enables them to send a lot of email to potential candidates (which can get spammy). This API wraps around a custom trained machine learning model that detects messages that are likely generated by recruiters.

## Machine Learning Model

- The private dataset used for training and testing is a set of 600 real emails sent to me and frequent collaborator, Andres Tavio.
- Each email was manually labeled as either a recruiter or not.
- RigdeClassifier-TfidfVectorizer was chosen as it was one of the highest performing models that was tested.


## Quickstart

- Clone the repo locally
- $ docker-compose build
- $ docker-compose up
