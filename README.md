# ReverseRecruiter API

An API that can be used to detect emails from recruiters.

## Motivation

Software recruiters use their own set of automated tools, which enables them to send a lot of email to potential candidates (which can get spammy). This API wraps around a custom trained machine learning model that detects messages that are likely generated by recruiters.

## Data for Model

- The dataset used for training and testing is a subset of real emails sent to me or my friend, Andres Tavio.
- Each message was manually labeled as either a recruiter or not.
